### Console

In JavaScript, the console keyword refers to an object, a collection of data and actions.
One action, or method, that is built into the console object is the .log() method. 
> console.log(5); 

### Comments
#### A single line comment 
> // Prints 5 to the console
> console.log(5);

#### A multi-line comment 
> /*
> This is all commented, none of this is going to run!
> console.log(99);
> */
